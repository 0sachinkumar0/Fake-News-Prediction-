###  Fake News Prediction

This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify news articles as **fake** or **real**. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and the use of supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. By transforming raw news text into numerical features (e.g., with TF-IDF), the models learn to recognize patterns that distinguish fake news from genuine articles. The system is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing an automated approach to help identify misinformation in news content.

Key Features:
- Cleans and preprocesses news text data
- Extracts features using vectorization techniques
- Trains multiple classification models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluates model performance and predicts on new articles
